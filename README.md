# Professional README Generator

## Description
I've created a command-line application that generates a high-quality, professional README.md file based on your project information. This application prompts you for details about your project repository and dynamically creates a README with sections like Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

## Table of Contents
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [License](#license)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
- [Tests](#tests)
- [Questions](#questions)

## Installation
To install the application, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Run the command `npm i inquirer@8.2.4` to install the required packages.

## Usage
After installing the application, run the command `node index.js` in the terminal. You'll be prompted to enter details about your project, such as the title, description, installation instructions, usage information, chosen license, contribution guidelines, tests instructions, GitHub username, and email address. The application will then generate a professional README.md file based on your input.
